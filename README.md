##Troubleshooting Steps##
1. Identify the Problem:
    - Gather information from the user about the issue.
    - Clearly understand the symptoms and any error messages.
    - Determine when the issue started and any recent changes made.
2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause:
    - Formulate a hypothesis about the possible causes of the issue.
    - Consider both common and specific causes based on the symptoms.
    - Identify whether the issue is hardware, software, or user-related.
3. Test the Theory to Determine Cause:
    - Perform diagnostic tests to validate or invalidate the hypothesis.
    - Use appropriate tools and techniques for hardware and software testing.
    - Isolate the issue to a specific component or area.
4. Create an Action Plan:
    - Based on the identified cause, plan the steps to resolve the issue.
    - Determine the best course of action for minimizing disruption.
    - Prioritize tasks and set a timeline for resolution.
5. Implement the Solution:
    - Apply the chosen resolution method carefully.
    - Document the changes made during the resolution process.
    - Communicate with the user or stakeholders about the steps being taken.
6. Verify Full System Functionality:
    - Ensure that the implemented solution resolves the issue.
    - Test the system comprehensively to confirm that all aspects are functioning.
    - Confirm with the user that the problem is resolved.
7. Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes:
    - Document the troubleshooting process, including initial findings.
    - Record the actions taken and the results obtained.
    - Use the documentation for future reference and to assist others.
8. Report Results:
    - Provide a summary of the troubleshooting process and outcomes.
    - Report any changes made to configurations or settings.
    - Share the resolution details with the user and relevant stakeholders.
9. Create a Knowledge Base:
