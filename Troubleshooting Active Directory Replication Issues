**Overview:**
Replication between Active Directory domain controllers is not functioning properly. This guide assists in identifying and resolving replication problems.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

    - Event log entries indicating replication failures.
    - Inconsistencies in Active Directory data between domain controllers.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

    1. Use the repadmin /showrepl command to check replication status.
    2. Verify DNS resolution and ensure that domain controllers can communicate.
    3. Check the health of the domain controllers' Active Directory databases.
    4. Review firewall settings to ensure they allow necessary replication traffic.

**Additional Tips:**

    - Monitor the Active Directory Replication Status tool for real-time replication information.
    - Schedule regular health checks using tools like DCDiag and Repadmin.
